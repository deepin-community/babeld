Description: loop-free distance-vector routing protocol
 Babel is a distance-vector routing protocol for IPv6 and IPv4 with
 fast convergence properties, described in RFC 6126. It was designed
 to be robust and efficient on both wireless mesh networks and
 classical wired networks. Babel has extremely modest memory and CPU
 requirements. Unlike most routing protocols, which route either IPv4
 or IPv6 but not both at the same time, Babel is a hybrid IPv6 and
 IPv4 protocol: a single update packet can carry both IPv6 and IPv4
 routes (this is similar to how multi-protocol BGP works). This makes
 Babel particularly efficient on dual (IPv6 and IPv4) networks. This
 implementation also includes a radio frequency-aware variant of
 Babel.
 .
 Babel has the following features:
  * it is a distance-vector protocol;
  * it is a proactive protocol, but with adaptative (reactive)
    features;
  * it senses link quality for computing route metrics using a variant
    of the ETX algorithm;
  * it uses a feasibility condition that guarantees the absence of
    loops (the feasibility condition is taken from EIGRP and is
    somewhat less strict than the one in AODV);
  * it uses sequence numbers to make old routes feasible again (like
    DSDV and AODV, but unlike EIGRP);
  * it speeds up convergence by reactively requesting a new sequence
    number (like AODV, and to a certain extent EIGRP, but unlike
    DSDV);
  * it allows redistributed external routes to be injected into the
    routing domain at multiple points (like EIGRP, but unlike DSDV and
    AODV).
