babeld (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the UDP port number and multicast group have been
    changed to be the ones allocated by IANA. In order to make older
    versions of babeld interoperate with this version, you need to add the
    following to babeld's command line: -p 6697 -m ff02:0:0:0:0:0:1:6
